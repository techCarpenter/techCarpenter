1. My [personal website](https://brianjdevries.com) built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)
2. A debt paydown tool called [Topple](https://github.com/techcarpenter/topple) built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the power of functional programming with Javascript and how to start working towards my [1000 true fans](https://ungated.media/article/tools/)

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn), [the JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), or functional programming.
